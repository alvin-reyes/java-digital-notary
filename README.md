### Java Digital Notary
It's common to be asked to have certain documents notarized when dealing with financial institutions. The
notary seal says in effect "I certify that this document was signed by this person on this date."  This
system works because it follows a simple process:
 1. The Public Notary verifies the *identity* of the person signing the document using some government issued photo Id.
 1. The Public Notary *witnesses* the person signing the actual document.
 1. The Public Notary applies a *notary seal* to the document to certify it.

These three steps provide most financial institutions sufficient confidence that the document really was
signed by the person on that date. But this process is time-consuming and requires the services of a
Public Notary. It also does not guarantee that the document can't be modified after it was notarized.

The advent of public/private key cryptography has made the digital equivalent of the notarization of
electronic documents easy and tamperproof.  The approach is simple, the person or program acting as a
digital notary generates a public/private key pair and keeps the private key safe.  The public key is
wrapped in a self-signed certificate and published in the cloud so that anyone can download and use it.
This facilitates digital notarization as follows:
 1. The digital notary creates a digital signature of an electronic document using the private key.
 1. The notary attaches the signature as a notary seal to the document and publishes it.
 1. Anyone who wants to verify the notary seal can download the public certificate and use
it to validate the seal.

### Highlighted Components
The following highlights the various components that are provided by this project:

 * *NotaryKey* - the private key that is used to notarize a document
 * *NotarySeal* - the tamperproof seal that contains the digital signature of the document
 * *NotaryCerticate* - the public key that is used to validate a notary seal created with
 * *Notarization* - the Java interface that must be supported by all notarization providers
 * *V1NotarizationProvider* - a notarization provider that implements version 1.x of the
notarization protocol
